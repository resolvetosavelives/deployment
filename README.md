# Redapp deployment

This project contains the deployments scripts and instructions for redapp-server.

## Getting started

The provisioning of servers is done using terraform, and ocrhestration is done using ansible.
The terraform scripts are not complete yet. The final topology of the infrastructure is also a WIP.
In the mean time, the following [instructions](docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_SETUP.md) can be used to setup a new enviroment from aws console.

Instructions to setup provisioned instances for deploys are in [ansible/README.md].
